</strong></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">One of the problems with CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) is that it means very different things to different people.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">For some businesses, it is a genuine, ongoing, relevant and sufficient investment in operating at the highest levels of sustainable and responsible best practice. For others, it is an elective or a nice-to-have.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Some businesses pay specialist consultancies to determine and enact CSR commitments rather than do them in-house. Those same consultancies are often also paid to promote the good news stories they duly create about the firm’s apparent commitment to responsible best practices.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Outsourcing responsibility, along with a variety of other factors, creates pressures and incentives to present as a responsible business rather than actually invest and commit more fully to actually being responsible. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It’s the job of pretty much all businesses to be selling us something all the time. Sales patter and marketing spiel have been jumbled together for generations. When doing CSR results in the publication of yet another glossy brochure laden with bold or optimistic claims from the corporation about its proffered values or credentials as good corporate citizens, people are quick to scoff.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">There’s no escaping the fact that succeeding in business is hard. Getting products and services to market at the right price and quality, under relentlessly competitive and ever-changing conditions, is difficult enough. Doing so whilst serving the full interests of people and planet at the same time is harder still.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the face of the current crises the world faces, and the various problems with CSR, our recommendation is to define the problems and solutions with different words and concepts.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Responsible 100 challenges organisations to practice responsibility as a skill. And to invest in changing actual policies and practices, to improve operational efficiency, reduce risk, and stimulate stronger culture, higher levels of innovation and stakeholder engagement. And to communicate their approach, targets, and progress to achieving their goals with due care and caution. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Why Responsible 100?
</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Responsible 100 helps any business to practice responsibility. And do so as a skill: normally, routinely, becoming more experienced and expert over time.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">We help all businesses, no matter their size, sector, or starting point, to be more responsible, for their own benefit, and to the benefit of everyone else. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Responsible 100 is unique in its diagnosis of the problem. Businesses around the world remain invested in ‘doing CSR’ yet, despite this (and to some extent because of it), we unflinchingly critique CSR in the ways we do because we’ve been working at the coalface for so many years. We’ve seen first hand how counterproductive it is for businesses to claim to be part of the solution while failing to ameliorate, mitigate or remediate any of the huge social and environmental crises we face.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At the same time we know that apportioning blame is not going to fix anything. We must share responsibility for the crises of global heating, biodiversity loss, poverty, inequality, human rights abuse, etc. No single actor is to blame. However, going forward, we can all take responsibility for helping to build and be part of a better economic system. And we can take issue with those who refuse to share responsibility or seek to cling on to or prop up our busted ‘business as usual’ approaches.  
</p><p>Responsible 100 is also unique in terms of the solutions it offers. As explained across the rest of this website, our prescription is to practice responsibility as a skill.
</p><p>We don’t ask businesses to reach a certain grade or milestone, to receive a certificate, to then sit back and bathe in the glory. We offer and support an ongoing commitment to optimising what you do and how you do it. It is about responsibility as a driver of operational efficiency, as a risk mitigator of risk, as a powerful tool for innovation, stakeholder engagement, networking and nurturing organisational culture.
</p><p>Responsible 100 empowers businesses to maximise their net positive impacts on people and planet, while delivering the goods and service the world wants, leveraging their new responsibility skills as a driver of commercial success, advantage and profit.
